Examine our code and determine if we need to refactor before
implementing new features. Checked.

Add a single alien to the top-left corner of the screen with
appropriate spacing around it. Checked

Use the spacing around the first alien and the overall screen size
to determine how many aliens can fit on the screen. We’ll write a
loop to create aliens to fill the upper portion of the screen. Checked

 available_space_x = settings.screen_width - (2 * alien_width)
 number_aliens_x = available_space_x // (2 * alien_width)
 available_space_y = settings.screen_height – (3 * alien_height) – ship_height
 number_rows = available_height_y // (2 * alien_height)

Make the fleet move sideways and down until the entire fleet is shot
down, an alien hits the ship, or an alien reaches the ground. If the
entire fleet is shot down, we’ll create a new fleet. If an alien hits the
ship or the ground, we’ll destroy the ship and create a new fleet.

Limit the number of ships the player can use, and end the game
when the player has used up the allotted number of ships
